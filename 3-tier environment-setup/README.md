**Three-tier architecture overview:**

The three-tier architecture is the most popular implementation of a multi-tier architecture and consists of a single presentation tier, logic tier, and data tier. The following illustration shows an example of a simple, generic three-tier application.

**Presentation tier**: Component that the user directly interacts with (for example, webpages and mobile app UIs).

**Logic tier:** Code required to translate user actions to application functionality (for example, CRUD database operations and data processing).

**Data tier:** Storage media (for example, databases, object stores, caches and file systems) that hold the data relevant to the application.

**Here I would perfer to using the aws cloud and terraform scripts for auto infra setup.**
